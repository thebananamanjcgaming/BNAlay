# How to customize the relay
 - Head to the TPLan folder and edit the dev.config file to append changes to the finalized relay. Do NOT change the domain or X-Header-Options.
 - Look for the variable function named "structure-tp_27935:8080_func" on line 5. Change the value to whatever you want as long as you don't change the BNA domain.
# That's all you need to know though :D
